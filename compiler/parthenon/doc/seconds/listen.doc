listen command

    (A) FUNCTION

        Listen command calls another instance of command interpreter,
        assigning specified file to its listening-stream.

    (B) SYNOPSIS

          [ listen ]   <file>  { <argument> }


    (C) PARAMETERS

        <file>
          specifies a string which is interpreted on as a script.

        <argument>
          specifies each of the arguments to be given to the
          script.

    (D) NOTES
        The argument-macro $0 in the file script is defined as "listen"

        If SECONDS finds an unknown command name given, it regards
        the command line as a listen command without "listen".

        Use listen command when a string must be used as listening-stream.

        The script which includes an listen command is pushed into
        stack when the listen is called, and resumes when the listen
        script ends.


    (E) SEE ALSO
        eval command
        leave command
