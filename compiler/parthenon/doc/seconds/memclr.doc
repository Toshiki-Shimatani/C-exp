memclr command

    (A) FUNCTION

        Memclr command fills a specified area of specified memory
        facility with a specified value.

    (B) SYNOPSIS

        memclr  <memory>  <start>  <end>  <value>

    (C) PARAMETERS
        <memory>
         specifies the faiclity to be filled, which must be a memory.

        <start>
        <end>
         specify an area in the memory to be filled.
         The <start> must be an unsigned integer, while the <end>
         may be either signed- or unsigned interger.
         A signed <end> specifies the end address of area as sum of
         <start> and <end>.

        <value>
         specifies the filling value as a bit string constant.
         The string is prepended with 0s or truncated if its length
         is respectively shorter or longer than the width of memory
         facility.

    (D) NOTES
        A memory facility in SFL is installed with being initialized
        as every bit being 'u'.
        
        Set command must be used for any facilities other than memory.

        A usage:

         SFL> memclr memory 30 10 0

        fills the 'memory' with 0 from address 10 to address 30:
        neither of the area from 0 to 10 nor the one from 30 to the
        tail is filled.
