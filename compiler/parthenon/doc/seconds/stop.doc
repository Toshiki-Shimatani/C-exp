stop command

    (A) FUNCTION
        Stop command limits the simulation time.

    (B) SYNOPSIS

         stop  [ <stop time> ]

    (C) PARAMETERS
        <stop time>
        specifies the upper bound of simulation time: simulation by
        using forward command is forced to stop when it reaches the
        specified time, even if the later time is specified with the
        forward command.

        It must be either an unsigned integer or an interger with '+'
        sign, where the latter specifies the specified number of
        times later with respect to the time when forward command is
        invoked.

    (D) NOTES
        When using this command with specifying an unsigned integer
        as <stop time>, and once simulation is stopped at the
        specified time, any further simulation is not possible until
        new stop time is set by stop command.

        SECONDS sets the initial stop time as '+1000'.
