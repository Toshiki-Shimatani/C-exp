sflexp command

    (A) FUNCTION
        Sflexp command reads an SFL source file and generates a
        netlist (in HSL).

    (B) SYNOPSIS

         sflexp <sfl_file_name> <hsl_file_name>
         sflexp . <hsl_file_name>

    (C) PARAMETERS
        <sfl_file_name>
        specifies a name of SFL source file.

        <hsl_file_name>
        specifies a name of HSL netlist file.

        The second synopsis specifies the same SFL source file which
        was used in the last use of sflexp or sflread command.

    (D) NOTES
        An error in the SFL source file produces a message such as:

         Error detected ! Shall I open the edit pad ? Type <CR> if ready.

        You can go on with typing <CR>. Editor program will be invoked
        with opening the file. Exit the editor after correcting the
        errors, then you will be waited by a prompt. Choices for the
        prompt are:

            r.: retry
            a.: abort
            h.: help

        where 'retry' retries reading the file, 'abort' aborts the
        sflexp command. During this session you may encounter a
        message such as:

         prolog: syntax error at LINE=2, COLUMN=0

        Input <CR> sometimes until the prompt ':' appears, then
        continue the session.

        Correct SFL source file does not lead the above session.

        Sflexp command may takes very long time.

    (E) SEE ALSO
        Sfldemo command works samely as sflexp, with more verbose
        reports.
