resource command

    (A) FUNCTION
        Resource command reports on cpu and memory usage.

    (B) SYNOPSIS

         resource

    (C) PARAMETERS
        None.

    (D) NOTES
        SECONDS itself never restrict the usage of cpu nor memory.

        Without restricted by administrator, SECONDS consumes as much
        memory resource as possible: SECONDS immediately aborts when
        it runs out of the resource.
