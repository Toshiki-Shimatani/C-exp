set command

    (A) FUNCTION
        Set command assigns a value of registers, stages, segments,
        tasks, instruct terminals, or data terminals.

    (B) SYNOPSIS

         set <facility> <value>

    (C) PARAMETERS
        <facility>
        specifies the facility to be set. Type of it must be either of
        register, stage, segment, task, instruct terminal, or data
        terminal.

        <value>
        specifies the value to assigne to the facility. When the
        facility is stage or segment, the value must be a state of the
        facility. For other types the value must be a bit string
        constant.
        If the lengths of the value and the facility does not match,
        the value is extended with 0 at MSB or truncated at MSB.

    (D) NOTES
        Stages/segements in SFL is initialized, by install command,
        with its first state.
        Registers (reg), registers-with-reset (reg_wr), and
        registers-with-set (reg_ws) are initialized with 'u', '0', and
        '1', respectively.
        This command cannot assign memory facility's value: use memset/memclr
        commands to initialize it.
