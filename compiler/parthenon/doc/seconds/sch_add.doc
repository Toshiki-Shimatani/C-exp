sch_add command

    (A) FUNCTION
        Sch_add command adds a cell to the schedule list.

    (B) SYNOPSIS

         sch_add  <time>  <key>  <script> {<argument>}

    (C) PARAMETERS
        <time>
        specifies the time when <script> is run, which should be 
        either of an unsigned interger, an interger with a '+' sign or
        the kind of distribution for a random number.

        The interger with a '+' specifies the time as sum of current
        time and the integer.

        Either of the following forms requests a random number which
        specifies the time as sum of current time and the random
        number.

            '%u' <min> ' ' <max>
              requests a (positive) random number which follows the
              uniform distribution between <min> and <max>.

            '%e' <min> ' ' <max> ' ' <mean>
              requests a posititive random number which follows the
              exponential distribution of the <mean> between <min> and <max>.
            '%n' <min> ' ' <max> ' ' <mean> ' ' <variance2>
              requests a posititive random number which follows the
              normal distribution of the <mean> between <min> and
              <max>, whose variance is sqrt (<variance2>).

        where each of <min>, <max>, <mean> and <variance2> is an
        unsigned integer.

       <key>
        names the cell to be added to the schedule list.

       <script>
        is a single token which includes the script to be run.

       <argument>
        is one of the arguments which is given to the script.

    (D) NOTES
        <time> must specifies a future time with respect to current
        simulation time.

        <time> must be lexically a single token when it is specified
        with an unsigned integer or an integer with '+' sign, though
        it must be 3 to 5 tokens, when specified as randomly generated
        time, according to type of radom number generation method.

        It possibly takes very long time to generate a random <time> value
        when it merely occurs for tempolary generated random number to
        resides between <min> and <max>. In the worst case the
        generation never finishes.

        The seed of random generator is randomly set on each time
        SECONDS is invoked, so different simulation results may appears
        from the same script.

        On the call of <script>, the eval command is invoked with
        applied to its first argument with <script> and to the rest
        arguments with <argument>.

        You can simulate mathematical queue models such as M/M/1 by
        using the schedule functionalities with the execution time
        specified with %e, as well as writing SFL stage which
        describes the behavior of the queue.

        New schedule cell created with sch_add command is added to the
        tail of schedule list. Use sch_mv command to relocate it or
        move it to other list.
