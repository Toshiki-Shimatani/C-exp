APOLLOCAP

USAGE

  %  apollocap [-p ] [-e <escape> ] <command>

FUNCTION

  Apollocap can help some of the cases in that the specified <command>
  does not correctly work with its I/O operations in a pad under Apollo's
  display manager.

  Ex.
   1) The program which utilizes select() system call with a File
      Descriptor associated with the pad.
   2) The program which handles controlling terminal (/dev/tty).

OPTIONS
  -p  should be specified with if the command's process or its
      descendants require tty interfaces (like /bin/csh). In that case
      a couple of ttys (/dev/ptyb?, /dev/ttyp?) is required.

  -e  specifies the character to cause a transition from raw mode to
      cooked mode. The character should be specified as a decimal
      number with the <escape>, which is regarded as ESC (27) if not
      specified.


PARAMETERS
  <command>
      tells a command line consists of the program executed in
      apollocap environment and arguments to be given to it.
      The line should be a sequence of tokens delimited with spaces,
      where the first token represents the name of program and the rest
      represent the arguments. The name should be in fullpath, except
      for the one in working directry.

MODE
  Apollocap has the following two modes. The interrupt character makes
  a trasition from cooked-mode to raw-mode, while the escape character
  makes the opposite transition.

    cooked-mode
      Usual functionalities of a pad under the display manager are
      available. It requires a care to send a signal to the process of
      <command> with either the interrupt- (^C) or quit (^\ or ^Q)
      character: the character must be preceded to by a quit
      character to avoid the interrupt character making the mode
      transition.

    raw-mode
      The usual functionalities are not available. That is, input
      characters will be passed to the program as they are (without
      echo). It should be done in this mode to do actions such as
      passing a password. The escape character makes transition from
      this mode to cooked-mode.
