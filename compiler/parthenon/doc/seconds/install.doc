install command

    (A)  FUNCTION
         Install command adds specified module to simulation image
         at specified postion.

    (B)  SYNOPSIS

         install  <module-class>  <position>

    (C)  PARAMETERS
         <module-class>
          specifies the module to be added to simulation image,
          with the class name of the module which must be regsitered
          as a module class.

         <position>
          tells where the module should be added in simulation
          image, which must be specified with name of a submodule facility.

    (D)  NOTES
         The <position> parameter of the first use of this command
         must be the root ('/') of simulation image.

         Each of the facilities in a module added to simulation image
         with this command is initialized as follows:
          1) memory        : every bit of every word is 'u',
          2) register/task : every bit is '0',
          3) stage/segment : their first state.
