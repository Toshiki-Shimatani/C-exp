dir command

    (A) FUNCTION
        Dir command shows or changes current working directory of
        SECONDS' process.

    (B) SYNOPSIS

         dir  [ <pathname> ]

    (C) PARAMETERS
      <pathname>
        tells a new working directory of SECONDS' process to move to,
        which should be specified in the pathname rules of native file
        system.
        Current working directory is shown if the <pathname> is
        omitted.

    (D) NOTES
        Each of nested calls with listen or eval command pushes the
        calling script into its internal stack for later return. 

        So it may occurs that a use of this command to change the
        current working directory in such nested scripts forces a
        called script to misdirect the caller to return.

        This is because each call closes the file of caller script,
        which must be reopened when the call returns.

        Such unexpected behavior can be avoided with using absolute
        pathname to specify an argument to listen command.

        2002/05/23: this bug has been fixed.
