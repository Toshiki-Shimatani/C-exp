rpt_add command

    (A) FUNCTION
        Rpt_add command append a cell to the report list.

    (B) SYNOPSIS

        rpt_add  <key>  <format>  { <faciliy> }

    (C) PARAMETERS
       <key>
         names the cell to identify it in the report list.

       <format>
        specifies a format string in which the report is put.

        Following rules are applied in the format:

         1) a character which follows '\' is put out as it is, except
           for 'n' and 't',
         2) '\n' and '\t' are put out as a newline- and a tab
           character, respectively,
         3) and a substring starting from '%' that is not a part of
            '\%' to the first non-numerical is called a conversion
            directive, which is put out with being replaced as
            describe below. Any character which is not included in the
            directive is put out as it is.

         A conversion directive is parsed as:

          "%" { <digit> } <conversion character>

        In a format, the n-th convertion directive, excluding the one
        with <conversion character> being 't', coresponds to the n-th
        <facility> parameter: the directive specifies how the
        facility's value is put out.

        The sequence of <digit> specifies the minimum width of the
        value's display. If the sequece is omitted, the width is
        specified as the one required for the value.

        How the value is put out is specified with <conversion
        character> as follows:

         <conversion character>       display
               b                  as a binary number
               d                  as a decimal number
               o                  as an octal number
               x                  as a hexadecimal number
               s                  as a state name
           any other              as a hexadecimal number

        Conversion character 't' put current time out in decimal.

       <facility>
        specifies the facility to be reported on.
        A word in a memory facility can be specified as:

         <facility>'@'<address> 

        where the <address> is an unsigned integer that locates the word.

    (D) NOTES
        In the case that the number of non-'t' conversion directive
        does not match to the number of given <facility> paramters,
        excess <facility> parameters are ignored and excess directives
        are put out as null string.
