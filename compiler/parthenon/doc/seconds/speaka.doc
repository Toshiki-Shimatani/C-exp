speaka command

    (A) FUNCTION
        Speaka command changes the destination of output (speaking
        file) by the later use of commands to specebfied
        file or standard output.

    (B) SYNOPSIS

         speaka  [ <file> ]

    (C) PARAMETERS
        <file>
        specifies the file to be the new destination.
        When omitted, stdout of SECONDS' process becomes speaking
        file.
        Using this command as "speak /dev/tty" makes terminal as
        speaking file, even if SECONDS has been invoked with being
        redirected to a file or a pipe.

    (D) NOTES
       The <file> is appended if it already exists, otherwise it
       is newly created.

       (may be obsolete information)
       When using this command on Apollo machine with assigning the
       display manager's pad to control terminal, "speak /dev/tty"
       never works as noted above without invoking SECONDS via
       apollocap. Do the followings, after creating two pairs of
       /dev/ptyp? and /dev/ttyp? by using /etc/crpty command.

 % apollocap -p /bin/csh                #enter to apollocap
 % seconds | < something >              #use seconds' output through pipe
 SFL > echo "to something"              #write to pipe
 SFL > speaka /dev/tty                  # --- redirection
 SFL > echo "to tty"                    #write to DM window to tty
 SFL > speak                            # --- redirection
 SFL > echo "to something again"        #write to pipe
 SFL > bye                              #exit from seconds
 % ^D                                   #exit from apollocap
 %
