exec command

    (A)  FUNCTION
         Exec command forks a child process which runs a shell on
         specified command.

    (B)  SYNOPSIS

         exec  [ <command> ]

    (C)  PARAMETERS
        <command>
          specifies a command given to the shell. It must be a single
          token.

          The shell executes the <command> if specified.
          Otherwise the shell waits for inputs.

          What shell is used depends on the value of environmental
          variable SHELL as follows:

                Value of the SHELL               Used shell
                  /com/sh                         /com/sh
                  /bin/sh                         /bin/sh
                  /bin/csh                        /bin/sh (not /bin/csh)

    (D) NOTES
        Each of stdin, stdout and stderr assigned to the child process
        is same as that of SECONDS and they cannot be redirected with
        listen, speak or claim command.

        It is not possible in the child process to change the working
        directory and an environmental variable of SECONDS'
        process. Use dir and setenv command, respectively, to change
        them.

        ldir command
        setenv command
