define command

    (A) FUNCTION
         Define command defines a script-macro.

    (B) SYNOPSIS

          define <name> [ <string> ]

    (C) PARAMETERS
      <name>
         tells a name of the new script-macro.
      <string>
         specifies the string to be defined as the contents of
         specified script-macro. The script-macro is forced to be
         undefined if the string is not specified.

    (D) NOTES
      The 'ARGC' is name of a reserved script-macro which SECONDS defines.

      The name with a single number is used as an argument-macro and
      cannot be used to define to be expanded to specified string.

      A script-macro defined with this command is effective only in
      the script where the macro is defined.

      If a macro name is used in the string expanded to from another
      macro and the name is not defined there, the name is regarded as
      of an environment-macro.

      The same name of a script-macro is defined as an
      environment-macro, the name is expanded to the string
      defined with the script-macro.

      An environment-macro can be defined with setenv command.
