forward command

    (A) FUNCTION
        Forward command repeatedly update the status of simulation image
        with increasing the simulation time.

    (B) SYNOPSIS

        forward  [ <stop time> ]

    (C) PARAMETERS
        <stop time>
          specifies the time at which the simulation stops.

          The <stop time> must be either form of the followings:
          1) an unsigned integer, which specifies absolute time to stop,
          2) an integer with '+' sign, which specifies the difference
             between the stop time and current time (i.e., the stop
             time will be current time plus the interger's value).
          In both case simulation is interrupted when it reaches at
          the time specified with stop command.

          The stop time is regarded as the time specified with stop
          command if <stop time> is not specified.

    (D) NOTES
        Simulation is interrupted with either SIGINT or SIGQUIT
        signal, which can be sent with ^c and ^q, respectively. On the
        interruption simulation image stays at the stable status of
        just waiting the next clock.
