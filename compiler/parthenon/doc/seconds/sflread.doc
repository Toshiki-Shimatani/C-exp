sflread command

    (A) FUNCTION
        Sflread command reads an SFL source file in and translate it
        into module class representations.

    (B) SYNOPSIS

         sflread <sflsource> sflread <sflsource> -exp

    (C) PARAMETERS
       <sflsource>
       specifies the name of SFL source file.

    (D) NOTES
        The module class cannot be directly simulated: you must build
        a simulation image by using install command.
      
        An error in the SFL source file produces a message such as:

         Error detected ! Shall I open the edit pad ? Type <CR> if ready.

        You can go on with typing <CR>. Editor program will be invoked
        with opening the file. Exit the editor after correcting the
        errors, then you will be waited by a prompt. Choices for the
        prompt are:

            r.: retry
            a.: abort
            h.: help

        where 'retry' retries reading the file, 'abort' aborts the
        sflexp command. During this session you may encounter a
        message such as:

         prolog: syntax error at LINE=2, COLUMN=0

        Input <CR> sometimes until the prompt ':' appears, then
        continue the session.

        Correct SFL source file does not lead the above session.

        Sflread command takes longer time than sflload command: it is
        convenient, after reading an SFL source file, to save each of
        the modules into file as a module class.


        Using this command as

         sflread <sflsource> -exp

        enables the use of such SFL constructs as memory or '+'
        operators that can be used only in SFL's circuit composite in
        the SFL's rule.
