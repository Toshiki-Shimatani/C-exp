 verbose [on|off]

        Change the verbose mode.

        If the verbose mode is "on", cost information is printed at each time 
        network manipulation command is applied.

        If neither "on" nor "off" is specified, the current verbose mode is
        shown.

        When this program starts, verbose mode is set to "on".
