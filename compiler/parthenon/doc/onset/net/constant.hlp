 constant
        Create constant-1 or constant-0 gates for constant output terminals.

        Constant-1 gate is an NAND gate whose inputs are connected to the
        input and the output of an inverter.

        Constant-0 gate is an NOR gate whose inputs are connected to the
        input and the output of an inverter.
