 cpb [n]
        Apply Critical Path Breaking and Resynthesis to reduce the delay 
        time of the network with simple gates.

        Argument, n, should be 1 to 4, and default value is 1.
        If value of n is larger, the effect of CPB increases.

        Value 1 is recommended for Area Minimization.
        Value 4 is recommended for Delay Minimization.
